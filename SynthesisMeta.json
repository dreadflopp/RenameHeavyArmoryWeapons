Updates descriptions of vanilla perks and their overrides (including changes from skill/perk overhaul mods) to include references to:\n- Polearms alongside greatswords\n- Spears and claws with one-handed weapons\n- Claws with daggers\n\nNote: Perk description updates always process all vanilla perks and their overrides regardless of which plugins are selected for weapon renaming.\n\nAll features can be toggled independently in settings.",
